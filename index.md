Topics are arranged by level. For a subject in level 1, we will assume the subjects in level 0 as preliminaries without making them explicit. In general, if you've finished high-school, you should be able to read Level 1, if you've finished the first first years of a BSc you should be able to read level 2, and so on.

## Level 0

The topics at this level are usually taught somewhere before university.

### General

* Numbers
* [Proofs](proofs)
* [Square of a sum](square-sum)
* [Binomial theorem](binomial-theorem)

### Calculus

* Limits
* Derivatives
* Integration
* Partial derivatives

### Linear algebra

* Basic linear algebra
* Dot products
* Matrix multiplication

## Level 1

These are the topics covered in the early years of most BSc programs.

### General

* Complex numbers

### Linear algebra

* [Matrix rank](rank)
* The determinant
* Matrix inverse
* [Eigenvalues and -vectors](eigenvalues)
* Singular value decomposition
* Pseudo-inverse
* [Quadratics](quadratics)
* Abstract linear algebra

### Calculus

* Taylor series

## Level 2

Topics generally covered in the later parts of BSc programs.

### General

* Numbers revisited

### Linear algebra

* The spectral theorem
* The fundamental theorem of algebra

### Level 3

Topics generally covered in MSc programs.

### Level 4

Topics that are usually no longer covered in organized educational formats, but rather in research articles or materials aimed at working scientists.
