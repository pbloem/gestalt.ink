Topics are arranged by level. Subjects in a lower level (including those not mentioned explicitly) are assumed to be mostly understood, and dependencies are not made explicit. In general, if you've finished high-school, you should be able to read Level 1, if you've finished the first first years of a BSc you should be able to read level 2, and so on.

## Level 0

The topics at this level are mostly taught in high school, or equivalent.  

## General

* Numbers

## Calculus

* Limits
* Derivatives
* Partial derivatives

## Linear algebra

* Basic linear algebra
* Matrix multiplication

## Level 1

These are the topics covered in the early years of most BSc programs.

## General
* Complex numbers

## Linear algebra

* [Matrix rank](rank)
* Determinant
* Matrix inverse
* [Eigenvalues and -vectors](eigenvalues)
* Singular value decomposition
* Pseudo-inverse
* [Quadratics](quadratics)
* Abstract linear algebra


## Calculus

* Taylor series
*

## Level 2

Topics generally covered in the later parts of BSc programs.

## General

* Numbers revisited

## Linear algebra

* The spectral theorem
* The fundamental theorem of algebra

## Level 3

Topics generally covered in MSc programs.

## Level 4

Topics that are usually no longer covered in organized educational formats, but rather in research articles or materials aimed at working scientists.
