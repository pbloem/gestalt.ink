Topics are arranged by level. Subjects in a lower level (including those not mentioned explicitly) are assumed to be mostly understood, and dependencies are not made explicit. In general, if you've finished high-school, you should be able to read Level 1, if you've finished the first first years of a BSc you should be able to read level 2, and so on.

## Level 0

The topics at this level are mostly taught in high school, or equivalent.  

## General

* [Number families](numbers)

## Calculus

* [Limits](limits)
* [Derivatives](derivatives)
* [Partial derivatives](partial-derivatives)

## Linear algebra

* [The very basics of linear algebra](basics-of-linear-algebra)
* [Matrix multiplication](matrix-multiplication)

## Level 1

These are the topics covered in the early years of most BSc programs.

## General
* [Complex numbers](complex-numbers)

## Linear algebra

* [Matrix rank](rank)
* [Determinant](determinant)
* [Matrix inverse](matrix-inverse)
* [Eigenvalues and -vectors](eigenvalues)
* [Singular value decomposition](svd)
* [Abstract linear algebra](abstract-la)
* [Pseudo-inverse](pseudo-inverse)

## Calculus

* [Taylor series](taylor-series)
*

## Level 2

Topics generally covered in the later parts of BSc programs.

## General

* [Numbers revisited](numbers-revisited)

## Linear algebra

* [The spectral theorem](spectral-theorem)
* [The fundamental theorem of algebra](fundamental-theorem-of-algebra)

## Level 3

Topics generally covered in MSc programs.

## Level 4

Topics that are usually no longer covered in organized educational formats, but rather in research articles or materials aimed at working scientists.
