No matter what I study, I can see patterns. I see the gestalt, the melody within the notes, in everything: mathematics and science, art and music, psychology and sociology. <br/>

Gestalt.ink is intended as a repository of general knowledge about, focusing on mathematics, machine learning and physics. Its primary aim is to provide an encyclopedic overview that allows to to jump in at random points. Each topic is discussed using a minimum of preliminaries, with those preliminaries that were unavoidable spelled out explicitly. 

<aside>The phrase <em>encyclopedic</em> refers to the intended tone and use. No promises about how complete the coverage will be.

The secondary aim, and this is where the name comes from, is to provide understanding through different perspectives. Often, a subject like eigenvectors is explained using one derivation only. For instance, an eigenvector is a vector whose direction doesn't change. While this is accurate and useful, there are many different ways to arrive at the same idea, and many different contexts in which they can be used. A true understanding of what eigenvectors are, comes only after you've followed a few of these derivations.

This is what we'll call a _gestalt understanding_: the understanding you get only from having seen different perspectives on the same thing.

A complete article will aim to provide such an understanding in a self-contained way. We'll always start with an executive summary, so if all you need is the basics, you can get them quickly. But, ideally, the longer you keep reading, the more insight you get.

## Guiding principles

The following principles guide our approach to most subjects. 
* **Short to long.** The assumption is always that somebody is reading with a purpose. They want to understand some subject in order to use it (possibly in an article for which it is a dependency, possibly somewhere else). We start with a short explanation and build on it to get them off the website as quickly as possible. This doesn't mean no long, careful explanations, it just means they should be preceded by shorter ones.
* **Minimal and explicit dependencies.** We will minimize as much as possible, how much you already need to know to understand an explanation. We will make all dependencies explicit, ideally including links to other articles. Where necessary we will re-explain required concepts in the context of the current article.
* **From concrete to abstract.** We will start with the most concrete form of something. For instance, we will explain linear algebra subjects using real-valued elements, abstracting to complex numbers of to general fields only later. This doesn't mean we don't deal in abstractions, just that we start with concrete examples and then abstract.
* **No popups, no payment.** These articles will be free, free of ads, and served in clean, minimal HTML.
